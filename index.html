                        <p>I really started learning this in elementary school, but it wasn't until later that I was learning this seriously. Sometimes I would practice very basic phrases with some hispanic students in the international schools I went to. In 2020, I met an Argentinian guy through my sister and he started teaching us Spanish weekly. After about 6 months, we couldn't really schedule any times that worked for all us. Then my family moved to Gainesville, GA, a small city that's also called the 'Little Mexico' of Georgia and at my job there at a Publix, I quickly found this out. Duolingo and spanishdict helped me keep up with Spanish as I served  customers that knew very little to no English.</p>

                    <p>I learned this language out of necessity as I moved to Turkey as a nine year old. I took classes in school while I was there and I didn't do well in those classes. Turkey didn't grow on me until the later years I was there, so I didn't really try to learn it until then.</p>

                    <p>Shortly after I moved to Turkey, there was a sudden in Germany that I can't really explain. I can't really remember how hard I tried with German, but sometimes in Turkey I was able to practice with some German. Listening to Rammstein keeps me interested in German.</p>

                    <p>As I was living in Wales, Welsh is not nearly as important in Wales as Turkish is in Turkey. I only took classes in it in school there, some people there spoke it but everyone spoke English better. Due to suppression from the English over centuries, less than 20% of the population speaks Welsh.</p>

                    <p>I've had a long but small interest in Russian after meeting a Russian friend and I've played a few video games that are partially in Russian. In Publix, I came across one Russian customer who's English was a little broken and I did a couple duolingo lessons. But soon after, we had another coworker who spoke Russian and due to that and the fact that we only have very few Russian customers, I stopped learning.</p>

I don't remember much Latin and it doesn't really interest me all that much since it's kind of a dead language outside of the Catholic Church.</p>
